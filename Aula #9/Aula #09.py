print("""Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s,
as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 
as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new 
features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using 
reference counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major 
revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and 
much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python 2 was 
discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020""")
